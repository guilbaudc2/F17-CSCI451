# F17-CSCI451

This repository describes the projects and files I created for CSCI451 - Mobile App Development.

---
The Projects are as follows (with branches numbered accordingly):

1. Java, Guessing Game
    - When the program begins, or the restart button is clicked, a random number between 0 and 100 will be created by the computer. This is the number the user will be trying to guess. Users will have 5 guesses in total.
2. Java, Objects
    - Create a shopping list app
3. Introduction App
    - Create an app that included:
       - A name
       - Three interesting facts
       - A picture 
       - A unique icon
4. Form Fields
    - Create an app that has two form fields and a submit button. When the user enters their data into the form and clicks the button they will see a Boo message.  
5. Multiple Choice Quiz
    - Create an app with the following criteria:
      - Be at least 5 questions
      -	Each question will have 4 multiple choice answers displayed as radio buttons
      -	Each question will have an image associated with it, which will be displayed on the question page
      -	Provide user's score at the end of the game, and give the user a message about their success depending on their score, e.g. perfect, or you really didn’t do well
6. Landscape
    - Create an app app that goes through a set of items and maintains data upon rotation:
7. Lists
    - Create an app with a list of items and a display
8. List Pager
    - Display categories in a ListView, and, when you click a category, users can swipe and page through the items within that category.
9. Two Pane Layout
    - Create an app with a list of items and a display
      -	When an item is clicked, you will go to the details page of that item
      -	When you click the picture of the item, a fact about that item will appear below it
      -	You will be able to swipe to page through the detail pages for the items
      -	When the app is in portrait, you will see just the list, and when you click an item, you’ll go to its details page
      -	When the app is in landscape, you will see both the list and the selected items details

10. SQLite
    - Create a new application with a list, a view, and a way for users to add data to the application, and save it to the database
